# README FILE FOR Threads

1. In order to compile the program type:
    "make"

2a. In order to run your program type:
    "make run"

2b. Or you can run it manually by typing:
    "./sds r w t1 t2"
    Where all of these values are positive integers

3. If you want to clean everything typeL
    "make clean"
    NOTE: If you want to run this program multiple times please run step
          3 everything. Because the sim_out.txt file is opened for 
          appending not writing.

NOTES:
    * Everything works fine
    * If your t2 time is 0 it might take a bit longer to get the output
      but I am 100% sure that it is not in deadlock. I tested this with
      the shared_data.txt file of 100 and it worked after 20 minutes.
    * Your shared_data.txt file must be separated by spaces all in one line
    * If you change shared_data.txt file you have to go to sds.h and 
      change the constant of FILE_SIZE to the new size of your shared_data
      -.txt. 
    * If you want to change the BUFFER_SIZE it is located inside 
      sds.h

FILES:
    sds.c 
    sds.h
    shared_data.txt - Test input file
